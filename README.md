# Campaign Analytics Dashboard

A weekend project I built while exploring advertising analytics. I wanted to get hands-on with the challenges of extracting value from campaign data through a working prototype.

## What I Built

This prototype explores a few ideas for working with campaign data:

### ðŸ’° Budget Allocation Optimizer
Suggests how to redistribute spend for better overall performance.

### ðŸ¤– AI Insight Generator
Uses LLMs to automatically spot trends and opportunities in campaign metrics.

### ðŸ’¬ Ask Questions, Get Answers
Ask about your data in plain English and get immediate answers - no SQL knowledge, no data expertise, no dashboard skills needed.

I worked with a dataset of 200,000 campaign rows containing metrics like ROI, conversion rates, and target audience information. While limited in scope, it got me thinking about the possibilities when combining Meta's campaign data with partner ecosystem data.

The Text-to-SQL interface could help cut through data silos, allowing users to query across previously disconnected datasets â€“ making insights accessible even as data complexity increases.
