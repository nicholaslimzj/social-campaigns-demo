It compares current quarter metrics (Conversion Rate, ROI, Acquisition Cost, Clicks, Impressions, CTR, Spend, Revenue, Campaign Count) against the rolling average and standard deviation of the previous three quarters using Z-score methodology. Flags significant deviations (absolute Z-score > 2) per Company and Channel combination to highlight potential issues or opportunities requiring attention. Filters to show only the latest quarter's results.",
