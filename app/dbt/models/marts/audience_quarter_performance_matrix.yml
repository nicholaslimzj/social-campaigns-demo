    description: >
      Analyzes audience performance metrics for the current quarter (last 3 months of available data).
      Aggregates key performance indicators (KPIs) like conversion rate, ROI, acquisition cost, and CTR
      at the Company, Target Audience, and Dimension (location, language, goal) level.
      Provides comparisons against company, audience, dimension, and global averages, along with normalized scores
      and a composite performance score for ranking combinations. Designed for heatmap visualizations and identifying
      high-performing combinations.
