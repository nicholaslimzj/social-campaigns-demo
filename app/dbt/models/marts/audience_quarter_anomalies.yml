  - name: audience_quarter_anomalies
    description: |
      Identifies anomalies in audience performance metrics at the Company and Target_Audience level for the current quarter.
      It calculates rolling statistics (mean, standard deviation) for key metrics using the three preceding quarters.
      Anomalies are flagged using a Z-score methodology, comparing the current quarter's performance against the historical trend (Z-score > 2 or < -2).
      This model provides context for each anomaly to aid investigation and is intended for use in anomaly detection dashboards, performance monitoring, and risk management visualizations.
      The output contains one row per Company and Target_Audience for the most recent complete quarter.
