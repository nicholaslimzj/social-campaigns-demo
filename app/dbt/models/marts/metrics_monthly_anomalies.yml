    description: |
      Identifies anomalies in monthly performance metrics per company by analyzing deviations from expected values based on recent trends (3-month rolling window).
      It calculates rolling statistics (mean, standard deviation) for key metrics, computes z-scores, and flags significant deviations (absolute z-score > 2) to highlight potential issues or opportunities requiring attention.
      This model aggregates data from the `stg_campaigns` model to a monthly level per company.
