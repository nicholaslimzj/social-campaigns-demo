    description: |
      Mart model that analyzes marketing channel performance and efficiency for the current quarter (last 3 months of data).
      It aggregates campaign data by Company and Channel, calculates key metrics like ROI efficiency, CPC, and CTR,
      and provides optimal budget allocation recommendations based on a simplified marginal returns model.
      The model compares current vs. optimal spend, projects potential revenue and ROI improvements,
      and categorizes recommendations by strength and direction. Designed for use in budget planning dashboards and tools.
