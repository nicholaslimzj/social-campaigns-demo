  - name: channel_quarter_anomalies
    description: "Mart model that identifies anomalies in key channel performance metrics for the current quarter. It compares current quarter metrics (Conversion Rate, ROI, Acquisition Cost, Clicks, Impressions, CTR, Spend, Revenue, Campaign Count) against the rolling average and standard deviation of the previous three quarters using Z-score methodology. Flags significant deviations (absolute Z-score > 2) per Company and Channel combination to highlight potential issues or opportunities requiring attention. Filters to show only the latest quarter's results."
