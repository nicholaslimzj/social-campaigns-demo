# Data Architecture Strategy

This document outlines our strategy for data processing tools selection based on specific use cases and requirements.

## When to Use Pandas

Pandas is ideal for:

- **Initial data exploration and profiling**
- **Complex data transformations** requiring Python functions
- **Creating visualizations** directly (with matplotlib/seaborn)
- **One-off analyses** during development
- **Working with small subsets** of data
- **Handling non-standard data processing** logic
- **Preparing data** for machine learning

## When to Use DuckDB

DuckDB is preferable for:

- **Aggregating data** across multiple dimensions
- **Filtering large datasets** efficiently
- **Joining multiple datasets** with SQL-like syntax
- **Running window functions** and complex SQL analytics
- **Creating materialized views/tables** for your dashboard
- **Performing regular/repeated queries** with consistent patterns
- **Handling time-series aggregations** (daily/monthly summaries)
- **Creating standardized data models** for reporting

## Recommended Workflow

Our recommended data processing pipeline:

1. **Initial data processing**: 
   - Use Pandas to clean CSV data
   - Save processed data as parquet files for efficiency

2. **Transformations**: 
   - Leverage DuckDB + dbt to create aggregated models
   - Apply business logic consistently across datasets

3. **Dashboard backend**: 
   - Use DuckDB to query models with user-defined filters
   - Optimize for interactive query performance

4. **LLM analysis**: 
   - Pull data from DuckDB
   - Process with pandas for specialized transformations
   - Feed structured data to LLM for insights generation
