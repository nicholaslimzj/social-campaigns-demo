# Implementation Plan for Meta SA Interview Demo

This detailed implementation plan showcases skills across data engineering, analysis, business problem-solving, Meta domain knowledge, and LLM innovation.

## 1. Data Engineering Pipeline

**Flow**: Raw Data → Preprocessing → Transformation → Storage → API Layer → Dashboard

### Step 1: Data Ingestion & Preprocessing

- Load CSV data using Pandas
- Standardize date formats (DD/MM/YYYY → YYYY-MM-DD)
- Normalize numeric fields (conversion rates, ROI)
- Handle missing values and outliers

### Step 2: Feature Engineering

- Create derived metrics:
  - Click-through rate (CTR) = Clicks/Impressions
  - Cost per click (CPC) = Acquisition_Cost/Clicks
  - Return on ad spend (ROAS) = ROI + 1 (for proper calculation)
- Add time-based features (month, day of week, season)
- Calculate performance percentiles within segments

### Step 3: Data Modeling

- Create dimensional model with:
  - Campaign dimension
  - Time dimension
  - Channel dimension
  - Audience dimension
  - Company dimension
  - Performance facts table
- Calculate benchmarks for each dimension

## 2. Dashboard Architecture

**Meta Campaign Analysis Dashboard** - Interactive artifact

## 3. LLM Integration Strategy

### A. Data Analysis Integration

- Create embeddings for campaign descriptions and goals
- Build vector database for semantic similarity search
- Implement prompt engineering templates for:
  - Performance analysis queries
  - Audience insights generation
  - Optimization recommendations
  - Budget allocation suggestions

### B. LLM Analysis Functions

**Performance Analyzer**: Identifies patterns in performance metrics
```python
def analyze_performance(campaigns_data, filters=None):
    # Filter data based on user selections
    # Calculate key metrics for selected segments
    # Generate natural language insights
    # Return formatted analysis
```

**Channel Optimizer**: Compares channel performance
```python
def optimize_channels(campaigns_data):
    # Compare ROI, CPA across channels
    # Identify over/underperforming channels
    # Generate recommendations for budget reallocation
    # Return actionable insights
```

**Audience Insights**: Analyzes demographic performance
```python
def audience_insights(campaigns_data):
    # Segment performance by audience groups
    # Identify high-value audience segments
    # Compare to benchmarks
    # Generate natural language analysis
```


## 4. Meta Features Replication

### A. Advantage+ Campaign Simulation

- Implement algorithm to analyze campaign performance
- Generate "what-if" scenarios for budget optimization
- Provide natural language recommendations

### B. Audience Insights Replication

- Build demographic performance analysis module
- Create visual representations of audience segment performance
- Generate audience targeting recommendations

### C. Business Suite Dashboard

- Design unified view of cross-channel performance
- Implement period-over-period comparison
- Create campaign health scoring system

### D. Budget Optimization

- Develop allocation algorithm based on historical ROI
- Implement forecasting for projected outcomes
- Create visual budget allocation recommendations

### Analysis

```javascript
// Let's explore the campaign data to understand its structure
// First, let's simulate reading the sample data
const sampleData = [
  {
    Campaign_ID: 529013,
    Target_Audience: "Men 35-44",
    Campaign_Goal: "Product Launch",
    Duration: "15 Days",
    Channel_Used: "Instagram",
    Conversion_Rate: 0.15,
    Acquisition_Cost: 500.00,
    ROI: 5.79,
    Location: "Las Vegas",
    Language: "Spanish",
    Clicks: 500,
    Impressions: 3000,
    Engagement_Score: 7,
    Customer_Segment: "Health",
    Date: "25/2/2022",
    Company: "Aura Align"
  },
  {
    Campaign_ID: 275352,
    Target_Audience: "Women 45-60",
    Campaign_Goal: "Market Expansion",
    Duration: "15 Days",
    Channel_Used: "Facebook",
    Conversion_Rate: 0.01,
    Acquisition_Cost: 500.00,
    ROI: 7.21,
    Location: "Los Angeles",
    Language: "French",
    Clicks: 500,
    Impressions: 3000,
    Engagement_Score: 5,
    Customer_Segment: "Home",
    Date: "12/5/2022",
    Company: "Hearth Harmony"
  },
  // Add more entries here...
];

// Let's analyze this data structure and create some helper functions
// First, we'll create a function to standardize dates
function standardizeDate(dateStr) {
  // Convert from DD/MM/YYYY to YYYY-MM-DD
  const parts = dateStr.split('/');
  if (parts.length === 3) {
    return `${parts[2]}-${parts[1].padStart(2, '0')}-${parts[0].padStart(2, '0')}`;
  }
  return dateStr; // Return as is if format doesn't match
}

// Calculate derived metrics
function calculateDerivedMetrics(campaign) {
  const ctr = campaign.Clicks / campaign.Impressions || 0;
  const cpc = campaign.Acquisition_Cost / campaign.Clicks || 0;
  const roas = campaign.ROI + 1; // Convert ROI to ROAS
  
  return {
    ...campaign,
    CTR: parseFloat(ctr.toFixed(4)),
    CPC: parseFloat(cpc.toFixed(2)),
    ROAS: parseFloat(roas.toFixed(2)),
    StandardizedDate: standardizeDate(campaign.Date)
  };
}

// Process all campaigns
const processedData = sampleData.map(calculateDerivedMetrics);

// Let's see what the processed data looks like
console.log("Processed data sample:");
console.log(processedData[0]);

// Now let's create a function to generate insights from this data
function generateChannelInsights(data) {
  // Group by channel
  const channelGroups = {};
  data.forEach(campaign => {
    if (!channelGroups[campaign.Channel_Used]) {
      channelGroups[campaign.Channel_Used] = [];
    }
    channelGroups[campaign.Channel_Used].push(campaign);
  });
  
  // Calculate average metrics by channel
  const channelMetrics = {};
  Object.keys(channelGroups).forEach(channel => {
    const campaigns = channelGroups[channel];
    const avgROI = campaigns.reduce((sum, c) => sum + c.ROI, 0) / campaigns.length;
    const avgConvRate = campaigns.reduce((sum, c) => sum + c.Conversion_Rate, 0) / campaigns.length;
    const avgEngagement = campaigns.reduce((sum, c) => sum + c.Engagement_Score, 0) / campaigns.length;
    
    channelMetrics[channel] = {
      avgROI: parseFloat(avgROI.toFixed(2)),
      avgConvRate: parseFloat(avgConvRate.toFixed(4)),
      avgEngagement: parseFloat(avgEngagement.toFixed(1)),
      campaignCount: campaigns.length
    };
  });
  
  return channelMetrics;
}
```

### Additional Analysis Functions

```javascript
// LLM-style insights generation function
function generateLLMInsights(data) {
  const channelMetrics = generateChannelInsights(data);
  
  // Find best performing channel by ROI
  let bestROIChannel = '';
  let bestROI = -Infinity;
  Object.keys(channelMetrics).forEach(channel => {
    if (channelMetrics[channel].avgROI > bestROI) {
      bestROI = channelMetrics[channel].avgROI;
      bestROIChannel = channel;
    }
  });
  
  // Generate insight about best channel
  const insights = [
    `${bestROIChannel} is your best performing channel with an average ROI of ${bestROI}, which is significantly higher than other channels.`
  ];
  
  // Identify underperforming channels
  const avgOverallROI = data.reduce((sum, c) => sum + c.ROI, 0) / data.length;
  Object.keys(channelMetrics).forEach(channel => {
    if (channelMetrics[channel].avgROI < avgOverallROI * 0.7) {
      insights.push(`${channel} is underperforming with an ROI of ${channelMetrics[channel].avgROI}, which is ${Math.round((1 - channelMetrics[channel].avgROI/avgOverallROI) * 100)}% below the average.`);
    }
  });
  
  // Generate audience insights
  const audienceGroups = {};
  data.forEach(campaign => {
    if (!audienceGroups[campaign.Target_Audience]) {
      audienceGroups[campaign.Target_Audience] = [];
    }
    audienceGroups[campaign.Target_Audience].push(campaign);
  });
  
  // Find best audience
  let bestAudience = '';
  let bestAudienceROI = -Infinity;
  Object.keys(audienceGroups).forEach(audience => {
    const avgROI = audienceGroups[audience].reduce((sum, c) => sum + c.ROI, 0) / audienceGroups[audience].length;
    if (avgROI > bestAudienceROI) {
      bestAudienceROI = avgROI;
      bestAudience = audience;
    }
  });
  
  insights.push(`Campaigns targeting ${bestAudience} have the highest average ROI at ${bestAudienceROI.toFixed(2)}.`);
  
  return insights;
}
```
